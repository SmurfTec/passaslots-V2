      c) The Sponsor offers free-to-play online social casino games to the
      public that are separate and apart from the Sweepstakes (the “Social
      Games”). In order to play the Social Games, players receive free credits
      (“Game Tokens”) at the time of sign-up and can also obtain free
      distributions of Game Tokens during the course of play. Game Tokens can
      only be used to play and extend play of Social Games; they are
      non-transferable by players, and cannot be exchanged for anything of
      marketable value. Players can also purchase additional Game Tokens for
      monetary consideration, and those who choose to do so will receive Sweeps
      Tokens as a free bonus upon the purchase of Game Tokens, or any other
      items offered for sale by the Sponsor for monetary consideration within
      the context of the Social Games. The number of Sweeps Tokens a participant
      will receive as a bonus for each eligible purchase will be stated on the
      Website.&nbsp;

      For each Request Card submitted in accordance with the above requirements,
      a player is eligible to have 5 Sweeps Tokens added to his or her Player
      Account. If the handwriting on a Request Card is not legible (as
      determined by Sponsor in its sole discretion), it will be void and Sweeps
      Tokens will not be credited to the sender’s Player Account. Each Request
      Card must only be made and sent by the individual indicated thereon and
      must be posted from the same state or province as the verified residential
      address of the said individual, failing which the Request Card will be
      declared invalid and Sweeps Tokens will not be credited to the
      individual’s Player Account. Tampering with the entry process or the
      operation of the Sweepstakes, including but not limited to the use of any
      device to automate the request/entry process, is prohibited and any
      Request Cards deemed by Sponsor to have been submitted in this manner will
      be void. All decisions concerning the validity of a Request Card shall be
      determined by the Sponsor in the exercise of its sole discretion, and all
      such decisions shall be final.&nbsp;

      5. Prize Restrictions. Potential Sweepstakes winners are subject to
      verification by Sponsor (in any manner it may choose) and the decisions of
      Sponsor are final and binding in all matters related to the Sweepstakes. A
      player is not a winner of any prize, even if an online screen indicates
      they are, unless and until the player’s eligibility and the potential
      winning play has been verified and the player has fully complied with
      these Official Rules and been notified that verification is complete.
      Sponsor will not accept screen shots or other purported evidence of
      winning in lieu of its validation process.&nbsp;
