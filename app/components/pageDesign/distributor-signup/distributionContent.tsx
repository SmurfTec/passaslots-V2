          Disclaimer: Hey there, just a heads up that we can't help with forgotten passwords, player accounts, or cashing out. We have distributors all over the world, but we don't screen or monitor all of them. So, if you have any payment disputes, you'll need to sort those out with your distributor. Unfortunately, we can't help with any disputes between players and stores. Thanks for understanding!
